This Folder is a modification of DSen2-CR, the cloud removal model proposed by Andrea Meraner and Patrick Ebel and Xiao Xiang Zhu and Michael Schmitt. See more information about this model in their o[open-access paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271620301398?via%3Dihub) and [github](https://github.com/ameraner/dsen2-cr). We do not have any affiliation with the authors and a large majority of our code is from their repository.

We cloned their github and added some modifications which we have documented, in order to get the model trained. 
We also provide code for extracting and reformatting the dataset in the way the DSen2-CR repository requires it in the **Dataset_Unpacking** folder.
